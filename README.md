# Digit Recognizer with Neural Networks
This project implements a neural network for digit recognition using the Digit Recognizer dataset from Kaggle. The code demonstrates the end-to-end process of loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, building a neural network with one hidden layer using He initialization, training the model with gradient descent, and evaluating its performance. Additionally, the project includes functionality to visualize incorrect predictions made by the model
